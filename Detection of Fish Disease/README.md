The title of the model is Detection of fish diseases in an aquaculture using machine learning techninques.
The data set was taken on three Diseases which are Red Spot (RS) , White spot(WS) and MAS(Motaile Aronamus Septisemiya) and if there is no disease we get None.
The model is based on KNN Algorithm and after that we have tested the model using test data . Finally the machine learning model predicts the disease of the fish.
